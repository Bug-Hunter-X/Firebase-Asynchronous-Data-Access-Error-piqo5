The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you attempt to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can happen if you use asynchronous functions incorrectly, such as using the data from a query snapshot in a callback function before the query has completed. For example:

```javascript
db.collection('users').get().then((querySnapshot) => {
  querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
    console.log(doc.data().name); // Error: May throw an error if data is not yet loaded
  });
});
```

This is because the `querySnapshot.forEach` function might execute before the data from the server has been fully fetched and populated into the `doc.data()` object.
